# Q3: Symbolic Quantum Simulation

Q3 is a symbolic quantum simulation framework written in Wolfram Language to help study *quantum information systems*, *quantum many-body systems*, and *quantum spin systems*; hence the name Q3. It provides various tools and utilities for symbolic and numerical calculations on these representative quantum systems. It was publically released in 2020.

## NOTICE

The official Paclet name of this framework has been changed to "QuantumMob/Q3" (previously, "Q3") following the convention of the [Wolfram Language Paclet Repository](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/). To load Q3, use `Get["QuantumMob/Q3"]` or `Needs["QuantumMob/Q3"]` (usually it is autoloaded when WolframKernel starts). The primary context is now "QuantumMob\`Q3\`" (rather than previous "Q3\`").


## Requirements

Q3 requires *Mathematica v13.1 or later*.


## Installation

Q3 provides a *fully automatic installation and update*. Please take a look at the [Installation Guide](./INSTALL.md) for the instructions.


## YouTube Video Tutorials

[YouTube video tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO3EQ7RIEy-eW2hPiaPQ24VuVOZytyS5m&feature=shared) of Q3 are available from [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO3EQ7RIEy-eW2hPiaPQ24VuVOZytyS5m&feature=shared).

## Quick Start

Once Q3 is installed, put `Q3` or `QuantumMob/Q3/guide/Q3` in the search field of the Wolfram Language Documentation Center (Mathematica Help window) to get users' guides and tutorials on Q3; see the following screenshots.

For more advanced uses of Q3, take a look at textbook ["A Quantum Computation Workbook" (Springer, March 2022)](https://link.springer.com/book/9783030912130).
A compilation of the Mathematica(R) Notebook files that have been used to generate the demonstrations in this textbook is available from
the [QuantumPlaybook repository](https://github.com/quantum-mob/QuantumPlaybook).


## Quantum Playbook

The [QuantumPlaybook repository](https://github.com/quantum-mob/QuantumPlaybook) provides more demonstrations of various subjects that could not be included in the [Quantum Workbook](https://link.springer.com/book/9783030912130).


## For Beginners of Mathematica

If this is your first time to use Mathematica, this guide written by Stephen Wolfram himself might be a good starting point: [An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language (2nd edition)](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/).
